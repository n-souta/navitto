Fixed navigation bar that follows H2 headings and shows a simple, sticky table of contents.

== Description ==

Navitto adds a fixed navigation bar that follows H2 headings in posts and pages.
It helps readers understand where they are in long-form content and jump quickly to sections.

**Features**

* **Fixed navigation bar** - Stays at the top or bottom while scrolling and lists H2 headings.
* **Display modes** - Show all headings, choose specific H2 headings, or hide the nav for each post/page.
* **Customizer** - Control preset (simple/theme), position, height, and font weight.
* **Bulk apply** - Enable or disable Navitto on all existing posts from **Settings > Navitto**.
* **Theme-aware offset** - Attempts to avoid headings being hidden under fixed headers.
* **Posts and pages** - Works on both content types.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The fixed nav does not appear =

* Ensure the post/page is not set to hide the nav in the Navitto meta box.
* Navitto appears only when the content has at least two H2 headings.

= How do I choose which headings are shown? =

Select **Choose headings to display** in the Navitto meta box, then check the H2 headings you want.
You can also override each heading label and set when the nav starts appearing.

= Can I insert the nav inside the theme header? =

If your theme supports the `navitto_fixed_nav_inside_header` filter and outputs Navitto inside the header area, it can render there.
Please refer to your theme's documentation.
